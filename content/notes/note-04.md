Looking at Mary Meeker’s slides (#marymeeker) this year one thing that stands out (slide 11) is the factor of ten installed base growth. Does that make the Internet of things, with ubiquitous input (appliances, clothes, road sensors etc) and output (screens everywhere on everything, and via HUD) a 100B touchpoint opportunity? 

Plausible? that would be 10-20 touchpoints per enabled person- I am already pretty much there...
