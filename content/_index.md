Many years ago I was on the edge of the Sahara desert and someone asked if I was "the Ed Simnett." To this day I have no idea if I gave the right answer.

In November 1996 a small web hosting company, Simplenet, advertised personal web pages (at your very own domain!) in Wired magazine. I think it was $20 a month. In one form or another this has been my corner of the web ever since. I was user ~6,000 of Linkedin and among the first 50K tweeters. Bill Gates once asked how to pronounce my name. All that, and $4, will get you a latte at Starbucks. 

After 20+ years in and around Silicon Valley I recently moved to Asia and have been spending more and more of my time writing fiction. The Notes here are separate to that and can hardly rise to the descriptor blog, but have occasionally proved interesting or useful "notes to self" or discussion starters.

Aside from my wife the person who helped the most on this technical and creative journey is sadly no longer with us. He was a very early web pioneer- as witnessed by a field trip to the Valley from New York in 1989: [HYPERTOUR 89](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqEDEnM7Ies).
